## I'm Oz, a postdoctoral researcher at Fermilab working on the intersection of AI and particle physics

I'm a member of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider hosted at CERN. 
CMS studies the fundamental particles and forces which constitute all matter in
the universe. 
By studying these particle we hope help answer many questions we have about how
nature works on its most fundamental level and how the many wonders in the
universe came to be.

We attempt to answer these questions by colliding protons at the highest energies possible, millions
of times a second, and measuring the results of these collisions in
sophisticated specialized detectors.
We use this avalanche of data to measure the properties of the known fundamental particles,
and to look for new particles which would play a part in answering some of these deep questions.

**I am particularly interested in ways in which AI can help us in this grand quest!**


One focus of my current research are searches for new particles based on **AI-based anomaly detection**.
There are many types of new particles which could be hiding in LHC data and is
impossible to design analyses to search for all of them individually. 
Anomaly detection is a new technique which searches through the data to find interesting 'anomalous' collisions new particles, without 
reference to a specific model of what new particles to look for. 
This allows searches with discovery potential to a much broader collection of new particles than traditional methods.  

I also work on **generative AI for fast simulations** of particle interactions in calorimeters,
**AI-enhanced data-collection** algorithms (triggers), 
and as well as various other new applications of AI in particle physics. 

Previously I also worked on precision electroweak measurements and various aspects of the CMS pixel detector.

I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 2022.
My thesis was titled ["Searching for Anomalies in Proton-Proton Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider"](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/items/4e704274-b8f6-4199-845d-d8d7e3eb1fa7).


I sometimes write for [ParticleBites](https://www.particlebites.com/), which summarizes recent particle physics papers for a broad audience.
