## I'm Oz, a postdoctoral researcher at Fermilab working on the intersection of AI and particle physics.

I'm a member of the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider. 
The CMS experiment tries to understand what the fundamental building blocks of
the universe are and how they interact. 
I am particularly interested in ways in which AI can help us
in this quest.


My current research focuses novel model independent searches for new physics
based on anomaly detection,
and using generative AI for fast simulations of particle interactions in calorimeters. 
Previously I also worked on precision electroweak measurements
and various aspects of the CMS pixel detector.

I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 2022.
My thesis was titled "Searching for Anomalies in Proton-Proton Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider".


I semi-regularly write for [ParticleBites](https://www.particlebites.com/), which summarizes recent particle physics papers at the undergraduate
level. You can read some of my recent posts
[here](https://www.particlebites.com/?author=30). 

I also had to my non-physics related blog I keep meaning to get back to
[EthicalAnalysis](https://ethicalanalysisblog.wordpress.com/).
