I'm Oz, a postdoc at Fermilab working on particle physics research.
I'm a member of the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider. 
The CMS experiment tries to understand what the fundamental building blocks of
the universe are and how they interact. 


My research focus is on model independent searches for new physics 
and fast simulations of complex calorimeters using machine learning methods. 
During my Phd I also worked on precision electroweak measurements. 
I have also worked various aspects of the CMS pixel detector, including the 
modeling of its radiation damage, novel reconstruction algorithms, and 
studies of designs for its phase-2 upgrade. 

I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 2022.
My thesis was titled "Searching for Anomalies in Proton-Proton Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider".



I also regularly write for [ParticleBites](https://www.particlebites.com/), which summarizes recent particle physics papers at the undergraduate
level. You can read some of my recent posts
[here](https://www.particlebites.com/?author=30). 

I also (occasionally) post to my non-physics related blog
[EthicalAnalysis](https://ethicalanalysisblog.wordpress.com/).
