## I'm Oz, a postdoctoral researcher at Fermilab working on the intersection of AI and particle physics.

I'm a member of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider hosted at CERN. 
CMS tries to understand what the fundamental building blocks of
the universe are and how they interact.
We do this both by measuring the properties of the
particles we know about, like the Higgs boson, and by looking for new particles.
I am particularly interested in ways in which AI can help us
in this quest.


My current research focuses searches for new particles based on anomaly detection.
Anomaly detection is a new AI technique which searches through the data to find interesting 'anomalous' collisions which may hint at new particles, without 
reference to a specific model of what new particles to look for. 
This which allows searches with discovery potential to a much broader collection of new particles than traditional methods.  
I also work on generative AI for fast simulations of particle interactions in calorimeters,
and AI-enabled data-collection strategies (triggers).
Previously I also worked on precision electroweak measurements
and various aspects of the CMS pixel detector.

I completed my PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 2022.
My thesis was titled "Searching for Anomalies in Proton-Proton Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider".


I semi-regularly write for [ParticleBites](https://www.particlebites.com/), which summarizes recent particle physics papers at the undergraduate
level. You can read some of my recent posts
[here](https://www.particlebites.com/?author=30). 

I also have a non-physics related blog I keep meaning to get back to
[EthicalAnalysis](https://ethicalanalysisblog.wordpress.com/).
