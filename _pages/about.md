I'm Oz, a graduate student in Physics at Johns Hopkins University. I'm a member
of the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider. 
The CMS experiment tries to understand what the fundamental building blocks of
the universe are and how they interact. 

My PhD research has focused on model independent searches for new physics using
machine learning methods as well as precision electroweak measurements. 
I have also worked various aspects of the CMS pixel detector, including the 
modeling of its radiation damage, novel reconstruction algorithms, and 
studies of designs for its phase-2 upgrade. 

I also regularly write for [ParticleBites](https://www.particlebites.com/), which summarizes recent particle physics papers at the undergraduate
level. You can read some of my recent posts
[here](https://www.particlebites.com/?author=30). 

I also (occasionally) post to my non-physics related blog
[EthicalAnalysis](https://www.ethicalanalysis.blog).
