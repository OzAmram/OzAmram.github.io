If new particles exist, they are likely produced extremely rarely, and may leave signatures very similar to those of much high rate background processes. So in order to perform searches, analyzers have to carefully design a statistical analysis to target a particular signal. Such analyses often have great sensitivity to the particular particle being searched for, but very poor sensitivity to anything else. While this approach was a spectular success in the case of an ‘expected’ new particle like the Higgs, one may wonder if we could be missing ‘unexpected’ new particles because we haven’t thought to (or had time to) search for them.</p> <p>This is the gap in coverage that ‘anomaly detection’ tries to solve. The strategy is use novel ML methods to cast a wider net that would otherwise be possible, making sure we are prepared for the unexpected. <a href="projects/TagNTrain">Tag N’ Train</a> <a class="citation" href="#TNT">(Amram &amp; Suarez, 2021)</a> , one of my projects from grad school, was one such type of anomaly detection algorithm. We showed it could be successfully find signals in simulated datasets and data challenges. But of course the real challenge is to actually apply it to real CMS data (and convince CMS beaurocracy to publish a crazy new idea like this).</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div style="text-align: center"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/CASE_jet_diagram.png" alt="" title="Cartoon of dijet anomaly signature" width="800"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A cartoon of the type of signature we are looking for : some heavy new particle A decays into two other particles, B and C which produce jets. </div> <p>The title of the paper is ‘<a href="https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/EXO-22-026/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Model-agnostic search for dijet resonances with anomalous jet substructure in proton-proton collisions at sqrt{s} = 13 TeV</a>’. ‘Jets’ are colimnated sprays of particles that show up in our detector originating from particles in the collision that interact with the strong nuclear force (ie quarks or gluons). They are the most common type of signature produced in a proton-proton collider like the LHC, which means searches for new particles producing jets will have large backgrounds that limit their sensitivity. While jets from different types of particles look the same on the surface, they can differ in terms of their ‘substructure’, or how the energy of the jet is distributed among the different particles in the spray. Normal jets produced by quarks and gluons typically have the majority of their energy aligned with a single central axis. But jets resulting from heavier particles can have their energy spead along 2,3, or more axes depending on the type of heavy particle. There is a huge space of possibilities for how the substructure of jets from new particles could look like. A program of searches targetting different substructure signatures has been ongoing for the last 10 or so years, but they have mostly focused on the simplest cases, leaving large number of possibilities still open.</p> <p>This search casts a wide net for these type of signatures, looking for any new particle decaying to two jets with ‘anomalous’ substructure, distinct from regular jets. Because we didn’t know exactly what we are looking for, we employed five different anomaly detection methods to identify anomalous jets. Each was done as essentially a separate analysis of the data, but all lived within a common framework: each method started with the same set of events, selected the events that appeared anomalous, and then used a common statistical framework to analyze the results.<br> The most important step is of course the selection of the anomalous events and because each method made different assumptions and used different techniques, we expected them to have complementary sensitivity to different types of anomalies. In addition to applying two of the algorithms (my own Tag N’ Train and a close cousin CWoLa Hunting) I also developed the analysis framework, statistical procedures, systematic uncertainties and coordinated the different teams.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div style="text-align: center"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/CASE_AI_algos.png" alt="" title="Different types of anomaly detection algorithms used" width="800"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> We used several different types of algorithms to identify potential anomalies. </div> <p>The different algorithms were based on different philosophies of how to identify anomalous jets. One approach, based on ‘unsupervised’ learning, trained a model that learned what standard jets looked like and then selected events that looked dissimilar from those as anomalous. Three methods employed what is known as weak supervision, in which a model is trained to separate two groups of jets in data, one of which is potentially signal-enhanced. The three methods were made different assumptions about the signal and background, and therefore constructed the two groups of data jets differently. Tag N’ Train was one of these methods, with its unique assumption being that both of the jets in the event are anomalous (other methods assume it could possibly be just one). The last method was ‘semi-supervised’, a hybrid between a fully model agnostic and standard approaches. This method used an ensemble of example signals as a ‘prior’ that potential anomalies may look like and then selected events that looked similar to these priors and dissimilar to standard backgrounds.</p> <p>Before unleashing these methods on the real data, we did extensive testing in simulation to validate them. We verified that no method had a significant bias in its selection of anomalous events such that the following statistical analysis would falsely claim a signal (ie no false positives). We also verified that for realistic amounts of signal present in the data, these anomaly detection methods could greatly enhance the discovery potential as compared to standard approaches. In many cases, a standard approach would have seen only very slight hints of a new particle (\(\sim 2 \sigma\)) while multiple anomaly detection methods would have been able to claim a discovery (\(&gt; 5 \sigma\))! Our testing also showed that there was no one ‘optimal’ anomaly detection method; they each performed better or worse on different signals.</p> <p>After all this validation we finally ‘unblinded’ and unleashed our algorithms on the real data. Unfortunately no method found any significant evidence of new particles :(</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div style="text-align: center"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/CASE_vae_mjj.png" alt="" title="Comparison of sensitivity of different analysis methods" width="600"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Mass distribution of the events that one AI algorithm selected as most anomalous. A new particle would have appeared as a ‘bump’, or excess of events at a certain mass value, on top of a smooth distribution of background events. Example bumps from two different signals are shown as blue and purple dashed lines. No such bump was observed. </div> <p>The typical thing to do with a null result search is to place limits constraining the existence of particles which your analysis was sensitive to. While this is a standard practice for a null-result search, it required significantly more work than usual for this type of analysis. First, I had to develop an entirely new method for calibrating the modeling of the substructure of exotic jets because prior methods were not applicable (this led to an entirely <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2924412" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">separate paper</a> on just this method). The other vary serious complication is that performance of the weakly supervised methods (aka signal efficiency) changes dramatically depending on the amount of signal in the data. Running on data with no signal present tells you nothing about what you would have seen had there been signal present (which is what you care about when computing an exclusion limit). So we had to employ a novel statistical procedure to account for this, which meant a lot of scrutiny in CMS internal review before eventually being ok’ed.</p> <p>In the end based on our results we were able to place limits constraining the existence of a wide variety of different particles. Compared to a traditional search strategy optimized for a single particle’s signature, the anomaly detection methods produced less constraining limits. However, they were able to set limits on a much larger variety of signal models than the traditional method (which is usually only be sensitive to that single particle).</p> <p>After spending many months agonizing about limits, I came to prefer a different method of quantifying the sensitivity of the anomaly detection methods. This metric computed how many signal events (aka cross section) would be needed to claim a discovery (\(5 \sigma\)) from each method. We showed that for several signals the anomaly detection methods were able to claim a discovery with usually with a factor of ~3-4 fewer signal events (Tag N’ Train even reached up to a factor of 7 for one signal). I think this metric highlights the spirit of anomaly detection: Its about increasing our chances of discovery! Not setting limits.</p> <p>This analysis was the first ever use of anomaly detection by CMS, and while it isn’t the first in particle physics overall (ATLAS has had a few results) it is definitely the most comprehensive. We used five algorithms instead of just one to have as broad of coverage as possible. We also significantly ramped up the power these algorithms by using many more discriminating features than prior searches. The technique I developed to calibrate the ML-based identification of exotic jets has now become standardardized and is being used in several other analyses.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/CASE_limits_new.png" alt="" title="Limits" width="500"> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-4 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/CASE_signif_new.png" alt="" title="Significance comparison" width="500"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left, exclusion limits on the cross section of different new particles from the anomaly detection methods (various colors) as compared to several standard approaches (black, brown, tan, gray).

This paper presents a new technique for correcting the substructure of simulated large-radius jets from multiprong decays. The technique is based on reclustering the jet constituents into several subjets such that each subjet represents a single prong, and separately correcting the radiation pattern in the Lund jet plane of each subjet using a correction derived from data. The data presented here correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1−1 collected by the CMS experiment between 2016−−2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The correction procedure improves the agreement between data and simulation for several different substructure observables of multiprong jets. This technique establishes, for the first time, a robust calibration for the substructure of jets with four or more prongs, enabling future measurements and searches for new phenomena containing these signatures. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">CMS-PAS</abbr> </div> <div id="Higgs_plus_X" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Search for resonances decaying to a Higgs boson in the bb final state and an anomalous jet</div> <div class="author"> CMS Collaboration </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>CMS-PAS-B2G-24-015</em>, Jul 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2928202" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> This note presents an analysis searching for new physics through the process where a new massive particle, X, decays into a Higgs boson and a second particle, Y. The Higgs boson subsequently decays into a pair of b-quarks and the decay products of Y are assumed to produce a non-QCD-like, e.g. anomalous, jet. In the benchmark process, Y decays into W + W − forming one large-area jet. A second benchmark process is also considered, where Y is a hadronically decaying top quark, originating from a vector-like quark decaying into a top quark and a Higgs boson. CMS data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016-2018 and corresponding to 138 fb-1 are analysed. In this analysis, the identification of the Y particle is enhanced by computing the anomaly score of its candidate jet using an autoencoder, allowing the simultaneous search for multiple Y decay modes with a single analysis. No significant excesses are observed and upper limits on the signal cross section for various masses of X and Y, at 95% confidence level, are placed. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Sub. to PRD</abbr> </div> <div id="Res_plus_X" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Weakly supervised anomaly detection with event-level variables</div> <div class="author"> Liam Brennan, Tamas Almos Vami, <em>Oz Amram</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

We demonstrate how anomaly detection techniques which have been developed for di-jet searches focusing on jet substructure anomalies can be applied to event-level anomaly detection in this topology. To robustly capture event-level features of multi-particle kinematics, we employ new physically motivated variables derived from the geometric structure of a collision’s phase space manifold.

The signal is assumed to produce jets with substructure atypical of jets initiated by light quarks or gluons, with minimal additional assumptions. Search regions are obtained by utilizing multivariate machine-learning methods to select jets with anomalous substructure. A collection of complementary anomaly detection methods - based on unsupervised, weakly supervised, and semisupervised algorithms - are used in order to maximize the sensitivity to unknown new physics signatures. These algorithms are applied to data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excesses above background expectations are seen. Exclusion limits are derived on the production cross section of benchmark signal models varying in resonance mass, jet mass, and jet substructure. Many of these signatures have not been previously sought, making several of the limits reported on the corresponding benchmark models the first ever. When compared to benchmark inclusive and substructure-based search strategies, the anomaly detection methods are found to significantly enhance the sensitivity to a variety of models. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">JHEP</abbr> </div> <div id="TNT" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Tag N’ Train: a technique to train improved classifiers on unlabeled data</div> <div class="author"> <em>Oz Amram</em> and Cristina Mantilla Suarez </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>JHEP</em>, Dec 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP01(2021)153" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a class="bibtex btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Bib</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12376" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>There has been substantial progress in applying machine learning techniques to classification problems in collider and jet physics. But as these techniques grow in sophistication, they are becoming more sensitive to subtle features of jets that may not be well modeled in simulation. Therefore, relying on simulations for training will lead to sub-optimal performance in data, but the lack of true class labels makes it difficult to train on real data. To address this challenge we introduce a new approach, called Tag N’ Train (TNT), that can be applied to unlabeled data that has two distinct sub-objects. The technique uses a weak classifier for one of the objects to tag signal-rich and background-rich samples. These samples are then used to train a stronger classifier for the other object. We demonstrate the power of this method by applying it to a dijet resonance search. By starting with autoencoders trained directly on data as the weak classifiers, we use TNT to train substantially improved classifiers. We show that Tag N’ Train can be a powerful tool in model-agnostic searches and discuss other potential applications.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">TNT</span><span class="p">,</span>
