    abstract = {This note introduces a model-agnostic search for new physics in the dijet final state. Other than the requirement of a narrow dijet resonance with a mass in the range of 1800-6000 GeV, minimal additional assumptions are placed on the signal hypothesis. Search regions are obtained by utilizing multivariate machine learning methods to select jets with anomalous substructure. A collection of complementary anomaly detection methods -- based on unsupervised, weakly-supervised and semi-supervised algorithms -- are used in order to maximize the sensitivity to unknown new physics signatures. These algorithms are applied to data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb-1 recorded in the years 2016 to 2018 by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excesses above background expectation are seen, and exclusion limits are derived on the production cross section of benchmark signal models varying in resonance mass, jet mass and jet substructure. Many of these signatures have not previously been searched for at the LHC, making the limits reported on the corresponding benchmark models the first ever and the most stringent to date. }

    abstract = {A measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry of pairs of oppositely charged leptons (dimuons and dielectrons) produced by the Drell-Yan process in proton-proton collisions is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The asymmetry is measured as a function of lepton pair mass for masses larger than 170 GeV and compared with standard model predictions. An inclusive measurement across both channels and the full mass range yields an asymmetry of 0.612 ± 0.005 (stat) ± 0.007 (syst). As a test of lepton flavor universality, the difference between the dimuon and dielectron asymmetries is measured as well. No statistically significant deviations from standard model predictions are observed. The measurements are used to set limits on the presence of additional gauge bosons. For a Z' boson in the sequential standard model the observed (expected) 95\% confidence level lower limit on the Z' mass is 4.4 (3.7) TeV.}

    abstract = {A new paradigm for data-driven, model-agnostic new physics searches at colliders is emerging, and aims to leverage recent breakthroughs in anomaly detection and machine learning. In order to develop and benchmark new anomaly detection methods within this framework, it is essential to have standard datasets. To this end, we have created the LHC Olympics 2020, a community challenge accompanied by a set of simulated collider events. Participants in these Olympics have developed their methods using an R&D dataset and then tested them on black boxes: datasets with an unknown anomaly (or not). This paper will review the LHC Olympics 2020 challenge, including an overview of the competition, a description of methods deployed in the competition, lessons learned from the experience, and implications for data analyses with future datasets as well as future colliders.}

    abstract = {Simulation is crucial for all aspects of collider data analysis, but the available computing budget in the High Luminosity LHC era will be severely constrained. Generative machine learning models may act as surrogates to replace physics-based full simulation of particle detectors, and diffusion models have recently emerged as the state of the art for other generative tasks. We introduce CaloDiffusion, a denoising diffusion model trained on the public CaloChallenge datasets to generate calorimeter showers. Our algorithm employs 3D cylindrical convolutions, which take advantage of symmetries of the underlying data representation. To handle irregular detector geometries, we augment the diffusion model with a new geometry latent mapping (GLaM) layer to learn forward and reverse transformations to a regular geometry that is suitable for cylindrical convolutions. The showers generated by our approach are nearly indistinguishable from the full simulation, as measured by several different metrics.}

    abstract = {There has been substantial progress in applying machine learning techniques to classification problems in collider and jet physics. But as these techniques grow in sophistication, they are becoming more sensitive to subtle features of jets that may not be well modeled in simulation. Therefore, relying on simulations for training will lead to sub-optimal performance in data, but the lack of true class labels makes it difficult to train on real data. To address this challenge we introduce a new approach, called Tag N' Train (TNT), that can be applied to unlabeled data that has two distinct sub-objects. The technique uses a weak classifier for one of the objects to tag signal-rich and background-rich samples. These samples are then used to train a stronger classifier for the other object. We demonstrate the power of this method by applying it to a dijet resonance search. By starting with autoencoders trained directly on data as the weak classifiers, we use TNT to train substantially improved classifiers. We show that Tag N' Train can be a powerful tool in model-agnostic searches and discuss other potential applications.},
