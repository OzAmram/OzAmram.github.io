The pixel detector is the innermost part of the CMS detector. It plays
a crucial role in seeding the tracking algorithm as well as determining the
precise origin of tracks. 
The pixel detector operates in an extremely harsh radiation environment, with the innermost layer sitting only 3 centimeters away from the 
beampipe. 
To maintain performance after ever changing levels of radiation damage, the
pixel detector must be continually calibrated with models of the radiation
damage. 

I have been involved in various aspects of the offline reconstruction of the
pixel detector including:
    - Developing novel reconstruction techniques suitable for high levels of radiation damage
    - Producing calibrations based on the simulations of the radiation damage using [Pixelav](https://inspirehep.net/literature/772925)
    - Testing candidate designs for the pixel detector's Phase-2 upgrade
    - Maintainence and improvement of the pixel reconstruction code within the [CMS software framework](http://cms-sw.github.io/)

Starting in September 2021, I will serve as co-convener of the Pixel Offline
calibration and reconstruction sub-group.
