    Physics doesn't work the same in the mirror!

When you look at yourself in the mirror, you appear the same except all of your features are 'flipped'. 
The name for this mathematical symmetry is called 'parity' and shockingly, we have known since the 1950's that our universe violates parity! 
For some particles, their mirrored versions behave differently than their regular ones. 
In this project I used CMS data to measure an observable called the 'forward-backward asymmetry' that quantifies 
the amount of parity violation in the process of a quark-antiquark annihilating to produce a pair of leptons.
By comparing our measurements of this observable to predictions from the standard model of
particle physics, we can look for hints of yet-undiscovered particles that change the amount of parity violation.

The measurement uses a novel 'template fitting' technique which allows us to
fit the observed angular distribution to templates of Monte Carlo events in
order to extract the parton-level asymmetry. 
We then use our measurement to set limits on potential heavy Z's.
Because the forward-backward asymmetry is mostly sensitive to interference
effects rather than direct production of the Z', the sensitivity is complementary to that of 
a traditional bump-hunt search. 
Additionally, the sensitivity will continue to
improve with more data, rather than being limited by the center-of-mass energy
like bump-hunt searches.

Non-CMS members tuned for the public result which should be out soon!
